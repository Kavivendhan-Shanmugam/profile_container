# Quick Photo Setup

## ðŸš€ Steps to Add Your Profile Photo:

### Step 1: Save Your Photo
1. Save the IMG_7314 photo (the one in yellow shirt) as `profile.jpg`
2. Copy it to: `C:\Users\Micro Start\Documents\profile\assets\profile.jpg`

### Step 2: For Background Removal (Optional)
- Go to [remove.bg](https://remove.bg)
- Upload your photo
- Download the result
- Save as `profile-nobg.png` in the assets folder

### Step 3: Quick Command to Add Photo
Run this in your profile directory:

```powershell
# Copy your photo to the assets folder (replace the path with your actual photo location)
copy "path\to\your\IMG_7314.jpg" "assets\profile.jpg"
```

### Step 4: Update the HTML (I can do this for you)
Once you have the photo in the assets folder, I'll update the HTML to use it.

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Result:
- **Front**: Character illustration (currently SVG)
- **Back**: Your actual photo with or without background
- **Hover**: Smooth flip animation
- **Click 11x**: Admin panel for editing

Let me know when you've added the photo and I'll finalize the setup!
